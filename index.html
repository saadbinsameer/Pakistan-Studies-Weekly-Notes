              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-4">üèõÔ∏è Week 1: The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC)</h2>
              <section className="text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-4">
                <p>The IVC, or Harappan Civilization (c. 3300‚Äì1300 BCE), stands as one of the world's original cradles of civilization and South Asia's earliest urban culture. It was primarily located in modern Pakistan, centered on the Indus River system.</p>

                <h3>üó∫Ô∏è Geography and Urban Centers</h3>
                <p>The civilization's massive extent stretched from Baluchistan to Uttar Pradesh and from Afghanistan to Gujarat, relying on the Indus River and its major tributaries (Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, Sutlej).</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Harappa (Punjab): A critical northern urban center.</li>
                  <li>Mohenjo-Daro (Sindh): The largest and best-preserved city, famed for its advanced municipal structures.</li>
                  <li>Lothal: An important site showing clear evidence of maritime trade.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>üèóÔ∏è Civic Life and Urban Planning</h3>
                <p>The IVC is defined by its unparalleled civic planning, suggesting a strong, centralized administrative authority focused on public welfare.</p>
                <p><strong>Architecture and Standardization</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Grid System: Cities were built on meticulous grid systems with planned streets and neighborhood blocks.</li>
                  <li>Dual Structure: Major cities featured a Citadel (raised, likely for administration or ritual) and a Lower Town (residential area).</li>
                  <li>Uniformity: Construction relied on universally sized fired bricks, along with standardized weights and measures across the civilization.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Public Health Engineering</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>The IVC possessed the world's earliest known advanced urban sanitation systems.</li>
                  <li>Domestic Systems: Most houses included private wells and toilets.</li>
                  <li>Drainage: Waste flowed into elaborate covered drains running beneath the streets.</li>
                  <li>Public Facilities: Major civic installations like the Great Bath in Mohenjo-Daro highlight an emphasis on ritual and public hygiene.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>üíº Economy and Society</h3>
                <p>Harappan society was specialized, supported by a regulated economy and extensive trade networks.</p>
                <p><strong>Economic Base</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Agriculture: The foundation was farming, primarily cultivating wheat and barley.</li>
                  <li>Craft Specialization: High degrees of skill were shown in bead-making (using carnelian), metallurgy (copper/bronze casting), pottery, and seal carving.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Trade and Administration</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Regulated Commerce: The use of standardized weights, measures, and steatite seals indicates robust administrative control over trade.</li>
                  <li>Long-Distance Trade: The IVC maintained vital commercial links with Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia, exporting finished goods (seals, beads) and importing raw materials (metals, lapis lazuli, cedar).</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Social Structure</strong></p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Housing: Dwellings ranged from two-room units to larger multi-room structures, but the variation in size was modest, suggesting limited extreme social inequality compared to other ancient empires.</li>
                  <li>Occupations: The urban population consisted of specialized artisans, merchants, and warehouse workers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>üé≠ Art, Culture, and Script</h3>
                <p>The IVC left behind a rich artistic heritage, although its deepest beliefs remain inferred due to the undeciphered script.</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Seals: Thousands of steatite seals featuring detailed animal motifs and short inscriptions were used for identification, administrative, and possibly ritual purposes.</li>
                  <li>Sculpture: The famous bronze statuette, the ‚ÄúDancing Girl‚Äù from Mohenjo-Daro, is a masterpiece of advanced metallurgy and naturalistic art.</li>
                  <li>Figurines: Numerous terracotta figurines (including female figures) and fine jewelry provide insight into aesthetic tastes and social/ritual life.</li>
                  <li>Indus Script: The short inscriptions found on seals and pottery remain undeciphered, leaving the details of their governance and religion largely a mystery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>üìâ Theories of Decline (c. 1900‚Äì1300 BCE)</h3>
                <p>The collapse of the highly urbanized Harappan phase was a prolonged event, attributed to a combination of environmental and socio-political stresses leading to de-urbanization.</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li><strong>Climate Variability and Drought:</strong> Palaeoclimate data indicates periods of severe aridity and the weakening of the monsoon system. This fundamentally stressed the large-scale irrigated agriculture needed to support huge cities by reducing river flow and surface moisture.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hydrological Shifts:</strong> Tectonic events (earthquakes) may have altered the course of the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river systems, leading to the loss of fertile land and crippling economic lifelines by changing trade and transportation networks.</li>
                  <li><strong>Flooding and Infrastructure Strain:</strong> Repeated, major floods constantly damaged vital infrastructure. The immense resources required for perpetual maintenance and rebuilding likely led to a crippling economic drain on the centralized system.</li>
                  <li><strong>Economic Disruption:</strong> A reduction in long-distance trade (due to changes in Mesopotamian markets or disruption of sea routes) weakened the specialized urban economy, leading to unemployment and urban depopulation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Socio-Political Reorganization:</strong> The internal breakdown of centralized coordination (for urban upkeep and water distribution) due to sustained environmental pressure caused a gradual, non-catastrophic de-urbanization as populations dispersed and adopted smaller, more pastoral/rural lifestyles.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disease and Conflict:</strong> Isolated evidence suggests periods of localized violence or widespread epidemics at certain sites, contributing to the abandonment of specific settlements, though this is not considered the primary cause of the overall collapse.</li>
                </ul>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-4">Week 3 ‚Äî The Process of Constitution Making in Pakistan (1947‚Äì1954)</h2>
              <section className="text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-4">
                <h3>Governing Framework After Independence (1947)</h3>
                <p>At independence (14 August 1947), Pakistan had no constitution of its own.</p>
                <p>The Government of India Act, 1935 (with necessary adaptations) was used as the interim constitution.</p>
                <p>The Constituent Assembly served a dual role:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Framing the constitution.</li>
                  <li>Acting as the central legislature.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Governor-General had extensive powers (especially under Section 102, which allowed suspension of federalism in emergencies).</p>

                <h3>Early Challenges to the New State</h3>
                <p><strong>Refugee Crisis (1947‚Äì48):</strong> Around 8‚Äì10 million refugees migrated to Pakistan from India, creating housing, employment, and food shortages.</p>
                <p><strong>Administrative Weakness:</strong> Pakistan inherited very few trained bureaucrats and officers compared to India, with key administrative offices and infrastructure lacking.</p>
                <p><strong>Financial Problems:</strong> Division of financial assets with India was delayed. Pakistan‚Äôs share of Rs. 750 million was withheld initially, creating economic strain.</p>
                <p><strong>Territorial & Security Issues:</strong> Conflict in Kashmir (October 1947) drained resources. Princely states like Junagadh and Hyderabad created political disputes.</p>
                <p><strong>Ethnic & Linguistic Tensions:</strong> West and East Pakistan had deep cultural and linguistic divides.</p>

                <h3>Leadership and Political Structure</h3>
                <p><strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1947‚Äì1948):</strong> First Governor-General of Pakistan, also President of the Constituent Assembly and head of Muslim League. Exercised immense authority beyond formal constitutional limits.</p>
                <p><strong>Liaquat Ali Khan (1947‚Äì1951):</strong> First Prime Minister. Introduced key initiatives like the Objectives Resolution (1949). Later leaders included Khawaja Nazimuddin, Mohammad Ali Bogra, and Iskander Mirza who faced instability.</p>

                <h3>Key Events in Constitution-Making</h3>
                <h4>Objectives Resolution (12 March 1949)</h4>
                <p>Presented by Liaquat Ali Khan. Declared that sovereignty belongs to Allah, Pakistan would be a democratic state guided by Islamic principles, and minority rights would be safeguarded. Became a foundational document and later part of Pakistan‚Äôs constitutions (1956, 1962, 1973).</p>

                <h4>Assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan (16 October 1951)</h4>
                <p>Liaquat was assassinated in Rawalpindi during a public meeting, creating a major leadership crisis. Khawaja Nazimuddin succeeded as Prime Minister, but political instability grew.</p>

                <h4>Language Movement (1952)</h4>
                <p>Tensions in East Pakistan over Urdu being declared the sole national language. Protests in Dhaka (21 February 1952) led to police firing and deaths of several students, becoming a turning point in East Pakistan‚Äôs political consciousness.</p>

                <h4>Anti-Ahmadiya Riots (1953)</h4>
                <p>Religious agitation in Punjab demanding declaration of Ahmadis as non-Muslims. Riots led to breakdown of law and order in Lahore. Martial law was briefly imposed in Lahore (first use of military in politics).</p>

                <h4>Bogra Formula (1953)</h4>
                <p>Proposed by Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Bogra to balance East and West Pakistan in the legislature with a bicameral system and equal representation in the upper house; it aimed to solve representation issues but was never fully implemented.</p>

                <h4>Dissolution of the First Constituent Assembly (24 October 1954)</h4>
                <p>The Assembly tried to curtail powers of Governor-General Ghulam Mohammad. In retaliation, he dissolved the Assembly and imposed emergency. Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan, President of the Assembly, challenged the dissolution. The Sindh Chief Court ruled in his favor, but the Federal Court (Chief Justice Munir) upheld the Governor-General‚Äôs action, setting a precedent for validating extra-constitutional steps.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion (1947‚Äì1954)</h3>
                <p>Political instability, weak institutions, ethnic tensions, and authoritarian tendencies prevented consensus on a permanent constitution. These developments paved the way for military intervention and martial law in 1958.</p>

              <section className="text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-4">
                <h3>Four Classical Theories on the Origin of the State</h3>
                <p>These theories attempt to explain the creation and justification of the political body known as the state.</p>
                <h4>1. Force Theory</h4>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The state arises when one person or group uses coercion (force) to dominate a population and claim territory.</p>
                <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A political order established through conquest or war. The conqueror enforces rules.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Adolf Hitler‚Äôs control of Germany and subsequent authoritarian rule.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Legitimacy flows from domination and the capacity to enforce order.</p>

                <h4>2. Evolutionary Theory</h4>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The state develops slowly and naturally out of early social units (family ‚Üí clan ‚Üí tribe).</p>
                <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> As groups grow and settle, leadership becomes formalized (chiefs/elders become rulers), and political institutions emerge organically.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Native American tribes forming larger political organizations with selected chiefs.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> The state is the long-term result of natural social evolution.</p>

                <h4>3. Divine Right Theory</h4>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Rulers are established by divine will; monarchs rule because God granted them absolute authority.</p>
                <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Obedience to the ruler is considered obedience to God. Rulers are above earthly accountability.</p>
                <p><strong>Historical Context:</strong> Supported monarchies across medieval and early modern Europe.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> A challenge to the ruler is seen as a sacrilegious rebellion against divine order.</p>

                <h4>4. Social Contract Theory</h4>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The state is formed when individuals consent to surrender some freedoms to a government in return for security and order.</p>
                <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A mutual contractual relationship exists: the state's authority is legitimate only if it protects rights and serves the common good.</p>
                <p><strong>Classical Proponents:</strong> Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau.</p>
                <p><strong>Key Point:</strong> The foundational theory for modern democratic and constitutional systems; emphasizes government by consent.</p>

                <h3>Core Ideas of Enlightenment Political Thinkers</h3>
                <h4>John Locke</h4>
                <p><strong>Core Concept:</strong> Natural Rights & Limited Government</p>
                <p><strong>Key Idea/Contribution:</strong> Government must protect unalienable rights (life, liberty, property) and is legitimate only by the consent of the governed.</p>

                <h4>Jean-Jacques Rousseau</h4>
                <p><strong>Core Concept:</strong> The General Will</p>
                <p><strong>Key Idea/Contribution:</strong> Sovereignty belongs to the people (the "General Will"); favored direct democracy as the purest expression of collective freedom.</p>

                <h4>Adam Smith</h4>
                <p><strong>Core Concept:</strong> Property Protection & Free Markets</p>
                <p><strong>Key Idea/Contribution:</strong> Argued for limited government interference in the economy; the state's role is to ensure property protection for prosperity via free markets.</p>

                <h4>Montesquieu</h4>
                <p><strong>Core Concept:</strong> Separation of Powers</p>
                <p><strong>Key Idea/Contribution:</strong> Proposed dividing government authority into three branches (Legislative, Executive, Judicial) with a system of checks-and-balances to prevent tyranny.</p>
