              <section className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-4">
                <p>The IVC, or Harappan Civilization (c. 3300‚Äì1300 BCE), stands as one of the world's original cradles of civilization and South Asia's earliest urban culture. It was primarily located in modern Pakistan, centered on the Indus River system.</p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-800">üó∫Ô∏è Geography and Urban Centers</h3>
                <p>The civilization's massive extent stretched from Baluchistan to Uttar Pradesh and from Afghanistan to Gujarat, relying on the Indus River and its major tributaries (Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, Sutlej).</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Harappa (Punjab): A critical northern urban center.</li>
                  <li>Mohenjo-Daro (Sindh): The largest and best-preserved city, famed for its advanced municipal structures.</li>
                  <li>Lothal: An important site showing clear evidence of maritime trade.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-800">üèóÔ∏è Civic Life and Urban Planning</h3>
                <p>The IVC is defined by its unparalleled civic planning, suggesting a strong, centralized administrative authority focused on public welfare.</p>
                <p className="font-semibold">Architecture and Standardization</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Grid System: Cities were built on meticulous grid systems with planned streets and neighborhood blocks.</li>
                  <li>Dual Structure: Major cities featured a Citadel (raised, likely for administration or ritual) and a Lower Town (residential area).</li>
                  <li>Uniformity: Construction relied on universally sized fired bricks, along with standardized weights and measures across the civilization.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="font-semibold">Public Health Engineering</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>The IVC possessed the world's earliest known advanced urban sanitation systems.</li>
                  <li>Domestic Systems: Most houses included private wells and toilets.</li>
                  <li>Drainage: Waste flowed into elaborate covered drains running beneath the streets.</li>
                  <li>Public Facilities: Major civic installations like the Great Bath in Mohenjo-Daro highlight an emphasis on ritual and public hygiene.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-800">üíº Economy and Society</h3>
                <p>Harappan society was specialized, supported by a regulated economy and extensive trade networks.</p>
                <p className="font-semibold">Economic Base</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Agriculture: The foundation was farming, primarily cultivating wheat and barley.</li>
                  <li>Craft Specialization: High degrees of skill were shown in bead-making (using carnelian), metallurgy (copper/bronze casting), pottery, and seal carving.</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="font-semibold">Trade and Administration</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Regulated Commerce: The use of standardized weights, measures, and steatite seals indicates robust administrative control over trade.</li>
                  <li>Long-Distance Trade: The IVC maintained vital commercial links with Mesopotamia, Iran, and Central Asia, exporting finished goods (seals, beads) and importing raw materials (metals, lapis lazuli, cedar).</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="font-semibold">Social Structure</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Housing: Dwellings ranged from two-room units to larger multi-room structures, but the variation in size was modest, suggesting limited extreme social inequality compared to other ancient empires.</li>
                  <li>Occupations: The urban population consisted of specialized artisans, merchants, and warehouse workers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-800">üé≠ Art, Culture, and Script</h3>
                <p>The IVC left behind a rich artistic heritage, although its deepest beliefs remain inferred due to the undeciphered script.</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Seals: Thousands of steatite seals featuring detailed animal motifs and short inscriptions were used for identification, administrative, and possibly ritual purposes.</li>
                  <li>Sculpture: The famous bronze statuette, the ‚ÄúDancing Girl‚Äù from Mohenjo-Daro, is a masterpiece of advanced metallurgy and naturalistic art.</li>
                  <li>Figurines: Numerous terracotta figurines (including female figures) and fine jewelry provide insight into aesthetic tastes and social/ritual life.</li>
                  <li>Indus Script: The short inscriptions found on seals and pottery remain undeciphered, leaving the details of their governance and religion largely a mystery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-800">üìâ Theories of Decline (c. 1900‚Äì1300 BCE)</h3>
                <p>The collapse of the highly urbanized Harappan phase was a prolonged event, attributed to a combination of environmental and socio-political stresses leading to de-urbanization.</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li><strong>Climate Variability and Drought:</strong> Palaeoclimate data indicates periods of severe aridity and the weakening of the monsoon system. This fundamentally stressed the large-scale irrigated agriculture needed to support huge cities by reducing river flow and surface moisture.</li>
                  <li><strong>Hydrological Shifts:</strong> Tectonic events (earthquakes) may have altered the course of the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river systems, leading to the loss of fertile land and crippling economic lifelines by changing trade and transportation networks.</li>
                  <li><strong>Flooding and Infrastructure Strain:</strong> Repeated, major floods constantly damaged vital infrastructure. The immense resources required for perpetual maintenance and rebuilding likely led to a crippling economic drain on the centralized system.</li>
                  <li><strong>Economic Disruption:</strong> A reduction in long-distance trade (due to changes in Mesopotamian markets or disruption of sea routes) weakened the specialized urban economy, leading to unemployment and urban depopulation.</li>
                  <li><strong>Socio-Political Reorganization:</strong> The internal breakdown of centralized coordination (for urban upkeep and water distribution) due to sustained environmental pressure caused a gradual, non-catastrophic de-urbanization as populations dispersed and adopted smaller, more pastoral/rural lifestyles.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disease and Conflict:</strong> Isolated evidence suggests periods of localized violence or widespread epidemics at certain sites, contributing to the abandonment of specific settlements, though this is not considered the primary cause of the overall collapse.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="font-semibold text-green-800">Cultural Transition & Legacy</h3>
                <p>After urban decline, the region saw increased rural/pastoral settlement and later cultural layers (early Vedic horizon). Harappan motifs, seals and artifacts remained culturally significant and are central to Pakistan‚Äôs ancient heritage; several sites are UNESCO-recognised and continue to be important archaeological resources.</p>

              <section className="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-4">
                <h3 className="font-semibold">Governing Framework After Independence (1947)</h3>
                <p>At independence (14 August 1947), Pakistan had no constitution of its own.</p>
                <p>The Government of India Act, 1935 (with necessary adaptations) was used as the interim constitution.</p>
                <p>The Constituent Assembly served a dual role:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                  <li>Framing the constitution.</li>
                  <li>Acting as the central legislature.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Governor-General had extensive powers (especially under Section 102, which allowed suspension of federalism in emergencies).</p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">Early Challenges to the New State</h3>
                <p><strong>Refugee Crisis (1947‚Äì48):</strong> Around 8‚Äì10 million refugees migrated to Pakistan from India, creating housing, employment, and food shortages.</p>
                <p><strong>Administrative Weakness:</strong> Pakistan inherited very few trained bureaucrats and officers compared to India, with key administrative offices and infrastructure lacking.</p>
                <p><strong>Financial Problems:</strong> Division of financial assets with India was delayed. Pakistan‚Äôs share of Rs. 750 million was withheld initially, creating economic strain.</p>
                <p><strong>Territorial & Security Issues:</strong> Conflict in Kashmir (October 1947) drained resources. Princely states like Junagadh and Hyderabad created political disputes.</p>
                <p><strong>Ethnic & Linguistic Tensions:</strong> West and East Pakistan had deep cultural and linguistic divides.</p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">Leadership and Political Structure</h3>
                <p><strong>Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1947‚Äì1948):</strong> First Governor-General of Pakistan, also President of the Constituent Assembly and head of Muslim League. Exercised immense authority beyond formal constitutional limits.</p>
                <p><strong>Liaquat Ali Khan (1947‚Äì1951):</strong> First Prime Minister. Introduced key initiatives like the Objectives Resolution (1949). Later leaders included Khawaja Nazimuddin, Mohammad Ali Bogra, and Iskander Mirza who faced instability.</p>

                <h3 className="font-semibold">Key Events in Constitution-Making</h3>
                <h4 className="font-semibold">Objectives Resolution (12 March 1949)</h4>
                <p>Presented by Liaquat Ali Khan. Declared that sovereignty belongs to Allah, Pakistan would be a democratic state guided by Islamic principles, and minority rights would be safeguarded. Became a foundational document and later part of Pakistan‚Äôs constitutions (1956, 1962, 1973).</p>

                <h4 className="font-semibold">Assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan (16 October 1951)</h4>
                <p>Liaquat was assassinated in Rawalpindi during a public meeting, creating a major leadership crisis. Khawaja Nazimuddin succeeded as Prime Minister, but political instability grew.</p>

                <h4 className="font-semibold">Language Movement (1952)</h4>
                <p>Tensions in East Pakistan over Urdu being declared the sole national language. Protests in Dhaka (21 February 1952) led to police firing and deaths of several students, becoming a turning point in East Pakistan‚Äôs political consciousness.</p>

                <h4 className="font-semibold">Anti-Ahmadiya Riots (1953)</h4>
                <p>Religious agitation in Punjab demanding declaration of Ahmadis as non-Muslims. Riots led to breakdown of law and order in Lahore, with martial law briefly imposed (first use of military in politics).</p>
